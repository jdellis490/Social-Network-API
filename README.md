# Social-Network-API

## Description 
This application was built for a mock social media api that generates simulated users, allows users to be created, become friends with other users, create thoughts, and allow users to post reactions to thoughts already created. This is a backend application which focuses on using `Express.js` and `MongoDB` using `Mongoose` to communication between them. This project allowed me to further understand more of the backend processes when in comes to databases and routing for future applications. I learned that most routes are usually similar with minor differences with parameters and structure. 

## Installation
To install, navigate to the terminal and type `npm run seed` to seed the database in mongoDB, then `npm run start` to allow connection to the database and express routes.

## Usage
Because this is more of backend project, the following videos will demo each route in `Insomnia` for Users and Thoughts, including friends and reactions management.
